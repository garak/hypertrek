<p><b>Data Stellare Sconosciuta</b>: Ora che il passato di Bashir è stato 
rivelato, gli viene richiesto di lavorare con un gruppo di persone che, come 
lui, hanno subito interventi genetici. Bashir si trova quindi con alcune persone 
che, differentemente da lui, sono rimaste nell'istituto dove ha subito 
l'intervento, ognuna delle quali presenta una caratteristica predominante: Jack 
(aggressivo), Lauren (sensuale), Patrick (frivolo), e Sarina (timida). Si spera 
che Bashir possa aiutare queste persone ad inserirsi normalmente nella società.</p>

<pre>                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               Together with our Dominion allies, we
               have given our enemies cause to fear us
               once more.

                              O'BRIEN
                         (dry)
               Can't argue with that.

In the background, Lauren gets up and moves so she can see the
screen.  For some reason, she too is intrigued by Damar's speech.

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered, continuing)
               The war with the Federation accomplished
               our goals.

Now Jack emerges from his room to get a closer look, as if drawn by
the sound of Damar's voice.

                              LAUREN
               Who is he?

                              BASHIR
               Damar -- the new head of the Cardassian
               Government.

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               We are safe behind secure borders, and
               no one will dare attack us again.

                              PATRICK
                         (with sympathy)
               Whoever he is, he's sad.

                              LAUREN
               Ashamed is more like it.

Bashir's never seen the group focus on anything before, and it
intrigues him.

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               The time has come for us to take another
               bold step that will ensure our future.
                         (beat)
               Peace.

Damar lets this hang in the air for a beat. Bashir and O'Brien
exchange looks -- this is better than a declaration of redoubled
hostilities, but they're not ready to take Damar at face value.

                              LAUREN
               Looks like he hasn't slept in days.

                              JACK
               Me thought I heard a voice cry &quot;Sleep
               No More! Damar does murder sleep!&quot;

                              O'BRIEN
               Quiet.

Bashir stops O'Brien before he says any more -- we see that the
Doctor wants to hear what they have to say.

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               It is time to bring an end to this war
               with the Federation.

                              LAUREN
                         (realizing)
               He killed someone.

                              PATRICK
                         (nodding)
               Someone close to him.

Bashir and O'Brien don't know what to make of their comments.

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               It is time for us to rebuild on the
               foundation of strength we have laid.

                              JACK
                         (Pointing at Damar)
               Pretender! He doesn't belong to the
               throne and he knows it!

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               Today I challenge the Federation to
               answer my call for peace.

                              LAUREN
               He's caught up in something he can't
               control...

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               I'm ready at any time to meet with its
               representitives to discuss how we can
               bring an end to hostilities.

                              JACK
               Someone's making him say all this.
               Someone he hates almost as much as he
               fears.

                              DAMAR
                         (filtered)
               I pledge that I will do everything in
               my power to protect Cardassia and allow
               us to move forward into a new era.
                         (beat)
               This I vow with my life's blood. For my
               sons... For all our sons.

And with that, the transmission ENDS and the screen returns to the
Cardassian emblem.

                              JACK
               Not bad, not bad at all. It's epic,
               really. The Pretender who kills the
               King and seizes the throne.

                              LAUREN
               Not the King, he's still alive.

                              JACK
               Right. That explains the guilt.

                              PATRICK
               The Queen maybe?
                         (even better)
               Or a Princess?

                              JACK
               Yes... Yes! And now the Pretender finds
               himself in a league with... a Dark
               Knight he can't control.

Bashir and O'Brien turn and look at each other, wondering how these
three could have gleaned all this from Damar's speech. Off their
puzzled features...

EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

Re-establishing.

INT. OPS

where an excited Bashir is telling Dax and Kira what happened.
O'Brien looks from his console.

                              BASHIR
               It was amazing. They pieced together the
               entire story of how Damar came to power
               just by watching his speech.

                              DAX
               Are you sure you're not reading to much
               into it?

                              BASHIR
               Don't you see? Weyoun is the Dark Knight,
               Gul Dukat is the deposed King, Damar is
               the Pretender to the throne, and Ziyal
               is the innocent princess he murdered.
               Now the Pretender is wracked with guilt
               over what he did, but he can't turn his
               back.

                              KIRA
               It pretty much hangs together.

                              BASHIR
               You were there, Chief. You saw what
               happened.

                              O'BRIEN
               It was weird, I have to admit.

                              BASHIR
               To them it was like some sort of
               Shakespearean tragedy. They were
               fascinated by the whole thing.  They
               started bombarding me with questions
               about Cardassia and the war. I've never
               seen them so engaged.

                              DAX
                         (sly)
               And you're going to try to keep them
               'engaged'?

                              BASHIR
               I don't know if I can; I'm running out
               of material.

                              KIRA
               What do you mean?

                              BASHIR
               They've already gone through everything
               the library has on Cardassia and the
               Dominion.

Sisko ENTERS his office -- something's on his mind and he can't
figure out how he feels about it.

                              SISKO
               Roll out the red carpet.

                              O'BRIEN
               Visitors, sir?

                              SISKO
                         (crossing down)
               Starfleet has agreed to enter into peace
               negotiations with the Dominion. Damar and
               Weyoun will be arriving in the morning.
                         (grimacing)
               I'm the lucky one who gets to sit across
               the table and try to keep from throttling
               them.

                              BASHIR
               That's great.

Sisko shoots him a look --

                              O'BRIEN
               I don't know. It's hard to believe the
               Dominion really wants peace.

                              KIRA
               I wouldn't be surprised if they were
               just stalling for time.

                              SISKO
               Maybe. I guess we'll find out.

                              BASHIR
               Sir, is there any way I can get a
               transcript of the negotiations?

                              SISKO
               You can do better than that.

Bashir is skeptical.

                              SISKO
                         (continuing)
               The Dominion is insisting that the
               proceedings be holo-recorded so that
               everyone can see their desire for peace
               is sincere.

                              BASHIR
               Perfect.

               And with that, Bashir turns and heads
               for the door. Sisko watches him go,
               wondering what that was all about.

                              DAX
               Look on the bright side, Benjamin. If
               you hurt somebody, everyone will be able
               to see what made you snap.

Off Sisko's face as he considers this...</pre>
<p>Versione riportata dal <i>Companion</i>:</p>
<pre>     DAMAR
   Together with our Dominion allies,
   we have given our enemies cause to
   fear us once more.

     O'BRIEN
    (dry)
   Can't argue with that.

 In the background, Lauren gets up and moves so she can
 see the screen. For some reason, she too is intrigued
 by Damar's speech.

 Jack emerges from his room to get a closer look, as if
 drawn by the sound of Damar's voice. Even Sarina is
 listening.

  LAUREN                                 DAMAR
 Who's he?                              (in background)
                                  The war with the

 Damar -- the new head of         our goals. Cardassia is
 the Cardassian government.       strong again, an empire
                                  to be feared. We are
  JACK                            safe behind secure
 &quot;Uneasy lies the head            borders, and no one will

 Bashir has never seen the group focus on anything
 before, and it intrigues him.

  PATRICK                                 DAMAR
    (with sympathy)               From this position of
 He's sad.                        strength, we are poised
                                  to take another bold step
  LAUREN                          that will insure our
 Ashamed is more like it.         future.
                                      (dramatic pause)

 While O'Brien listens to the speech, Bashir looks
 around at the group. He's not quite sure what to make
 of their comments.

                                          DAMAR
                                  Peace.
  BASHIR                              (a long beat)
    (to Lauren)
 Why do you say that?

  O'BRIEN                                 DAMAR
    (to Bashir)                   It is time to bring an
 Shhh.                            end to this war with the

 doesn't sleep.                   we have laid.
                                      (beat)
  JACK                            The sons of Cardassia
 &quot;Methought I heard a             shed their blood to

  PATRICK                                 DAMAR
    (realizing)                   The peace we seek will

  LAUREN                          which they gave their
    (agreeing)                    lives.
 Someone close to him.                 (beat)

 Bashir and O'Brien exchange a look. They can't
 understand how Jack and the others are seeing all these
 things.

  O'BRIEN                                 DAMAR
  (to Bashir)                     Today I challenge the
 How could they know that?        Federation to answer my
                                  call for peace. I'm
  JACK                            ready at any time to meet

 Pretender! You don't             to discuss how we can
 belong on that throne and        bring an end to

                                  leader, I pledge that I
  PATRICK                         will do everything in my
 Someone's making him say         power to protect
 all this. He doesn't             Cardassia and allow us
 want to.                         to move forward into a
                                  new era.
                                       (beat)
                                  This I vow with my life's blood.

 And with that, the transmission ENDS and the screen
 returns to the Cardassian emblem. Bashir looks at the
 group trying to understand what's happened.

     BASHIR
   Did any of you know who Damar was
   before today?

     JACK
   No, but it's obvious who he is.
   The Pretender who killed the king
   and seized the throne.

     LAUREN
   Not the king, he's still alive.

     PATRICK
   The queen maybe?
    (even better)
   Or a princess.

     BASHIR
   Yes. Gul Dukat's daughter. Her
   name was Ziyal.

     JACK
   And now the Pretender finds
   himself in league with a... a Dark
   Knight he can't control.

     O'BRIEN
    (to Bashir)
   Weyoun?

 Bashir and O'Brien look at each other, wondering how
 the hell these three could have gleaned all this from
 Damar's speech.

     JACK
   Not a bad story. It's epic
   really.
    (to Bashir)
   What else can you tell us?

 Off this moment...

19   OMITTED

20   INT. OPS

 where an excited Bashir is telling Dax and Kira what
 happened.

     BASHIR
   It was amazing. They pieced
   together the entire story of how
   Damar came to power. Don't you
   see?
   Weyoun is the Dark Knight, Gul
   Dukat is the deposed King, Damar
   is the Pretender to the throne,
   and Ziyal is the innocent Princess
   he murdered. Now the Pretender is
   wracked with guilt over what he
   did.

     KIRA
   And they got all that just from
   watching Damar's speech?

     BASHIR
    (nods)
   They were fascinated by the whole
   thing, started bombarding me with
   questions about Cardassia and the
   war. I've never seen them so
   engaged.

     DAX
   And you want to keep them engaged?
     BASHIR
   I'm going to try, but I'm running
   out of material.

     KIRA
   What do you mean?

     BASHIR
   They've already gone through
   everything the computer has on
   Cardassia and the Dominion.

 Sisko ENTERS from his office -- something's on his mind
 and he can't figure out how he feels about it.

     SISKO
   Roll out the red carpet.

     DAX
   Visitors?

     SISKO
    (crossing down)
   Starfleet has agreed to listen to
   what Damar has to say. He and
   Weyoun will be arriving in the
   morning.
    (grimacing)
   I'm the lucky one who gets to sit
   across the table from them.

     BASHIR
   This is great.

 Sisko shoots him a look --

     KIRA
   It's hard to believe the Dominion
   really wants peace. I wouldn't be
   surprised if they were just
   stalling for time in order to
   regroup.

     BASHIR
   Sir, is there any way I can get a
   transcript of the negotiations?

     SISKO
   You can do better than that.
    (skeptical)
   The Dominion insisted on recording
   the proceedings so everyone can
   see that their desire for peace is
   sincere.

     BASHIR
   Perfect.

 And with that, Bashir turns and heads for the door.
 Sisko watches him go, wondering what that was all
 about.

    DAX
   You shouldn't've agreed to that,
   Benjamin.
    (off his look)
   Now you're going to have to be on
   your best behavior.

 Off Sisko's face as he considers this...</pre>
<h4><a name="Scenetagliate">Scene tagliate</a></h4>
<p>Ecco com'era stata pensata la scena in cui Bashir chiede a Sarina di essere 
liberato dalle corde. La prima e le ultime due battute di Bashir, con piccole 
variazioni, sono quelle dette nell'episodio.</p>
<pre>     BASHIR
   Untie me. Please.
    (no response)
   Sarina.

 She says nothing. Frustrated, Bashir struggles to free
 himself. After a few beats, he's surprised to hear a
 small, tremulous voice --

     SARINA
   I'm sorry.

 Bashir reacts to the first words he's ever heard her
 speak, realizing that she must be conflicted if she's
 driven to utter them.

 She has to pull herself up from the deep well she's
 lived in for so many years -- she doesn't know how to
 say what she feels, she doesn't even know what she
 feels.

     SARINA
   I can't untie you.

     BASHIR
    (gently)
   Yes, you can. If you think it's
   the right thing to do.

     SARINA
    (at a loss)
   I don't know...

     BASHIR
   I think you do. I think that's
   why you spoke to me just now. You
   could've stayed quiet, but you
   didn't. And the only reason I can
   think of is that you don't want to
   have the deaths of so many people
   on your hands.

     SARINA
   Jack would be mad.

 Bashir realizes something about her that he's been
 sensing all along -- seeing an opening, he eases his
 way toward it.

     BASHIR
    (gently)
   Yes, he would. And I know you
   don't want that to happen.

 Bashir sees something flicker across her features, and
 he knows what he's thinking is true --

     BASHIR
   I've seen the way you look at him
   when you think no one is watching.
   I know how much you care about
   him.

 Sarina looks down, trying to shut out his words.
 Emotion is so alien to her that it's painful for her to
 feel so exposed.

     BASHIR
   Sarina, if you don't let me stop
   them, they're going to be arrested
   and charged with treason. Do you
   know what that means? You'll
   never see any of them again.
    (beat)
   You'll never see Jack again.

 She looks up, stricken by this thought. Bashir holds
 her gaze, says nothing more. He knows he has to let
 her sit with this for a moment and decide what she
 wants to do. Off Sarina's face as we wonder what
 she'll do...</pre>
